<h2>ALGORITHMS</h2>
<h3>The objective of this course is to prepare the student with the algorithmic foundations of computing.
A sound grasp of algorithms is essential for any computer science engineer. Almost all programming
involves algorithms at some level.
</h3>
<h3>Unit 1:</h3>
<h4>IProgramming Models. Data Abstraction. Sets, Multisets, Stacks, Queues. 
Asymptotic and worst-case analysis of algorithms.
 </h4>
<h3>Unit 2:</h3>
<h4>The sorting problem. Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort, Mergesort, Quicksort </h4>
<h3>Unit 3:</h3>
<h4>Symbol Tables, Binary Search Trees, Balanced Search Trees. Hash Tables.
 </h4>
<h3>Unit 4:</h3>
<h4>Definition of a directed and undirected graph. Paths, Cycles, spanning trees. Directed Acyclic Graphs.
Topological Sorting. Minimum Spanning Tree algorithms. Shortest Path algorithms: Dijkstra s algorithm. Flow-based algorithms. </h4>
<h3>Unit 5:</h3>
<h4>String Sort. Tries. Substring Search. Regular Expressions. Elementary Data compression </h4>
